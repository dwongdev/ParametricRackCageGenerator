 Quickly create a 3D-printable object file for a rack cage for any device
 of a given size. Simply provide the device's dimensions, and optionally
 tweak a few settings, then press F6 then F7 to generate and save a STL
 file.

 Patch Notes
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 0.1 - 10 Aug 2025 
   Initial Release
 
 0.11 - 29 Aug 2025
   - Added support for heat-set threaded inserts on faceplate ears for half-
     and third-width cages for 19" racks. (Requested by Github user "woolmonkey".)
 
 0.12 - 30 Aug 2025
   - Added support for half-height cages as well as half-width for 10" racks.
     (Requested by Github user "FlyingT".)
 
 0.20 - 21 Dec 2025
   - Added the ability to split any cage in half, for printing within a smaller 
     print volume, e.g., 10" 2U rack cage on a 220mm^2 print bed (e.g., Ender3).
     This requires additional compute time, however, as the script will create
     two complete copies of the full cage and then split them each in half so
     as to handle asymmetric cages.
   - Added an option for alignment pin holes on split cages, for better alignment
     and increased durability.
   - Added the capability to shift the cage side-to-side by changing an offset
     value.
   - Added the capability to modify the cage faceplate to add things like Keystone
     module receptacles and a few common cooling fan sizes.
   - Added an on-screen ruler to assist in determining offset values for shifting
     things around.
   - Added a configurable outline to indicate the build volume of the 3D printer
     to be used to print cages, for easier design planning.
   - Added better fastener support, including close-clearance, tapped, and heat-
     set inserts in multiple sizes (M3 to M6 and 4-40 to 1/4-20).
   - Added more verbiage to options in the Customizer to make the script easier
     to use.
   - Made bolt-together ears automatic for half-/third-width cages - selecting a
     partial-rack width auto-enables the appropriate ears on one or both sides.
   - Added the option to reinforce the faceplate by adding a "rolled edge" to the
     top and mottom edges on the back side of the faceplate.
   - Modified the support structure generation code to increase the structure's
     size when increasing the "heavy device" setting, which allows fitting smaller
     devices into fewer units when they don't require thickened supports. The new
     device height limit on otherwise-default settings is 28mm/unit.
   - Consolidated some options to make the script easier to use.
   - Fixed a number of bugs and consolidated the script's code.
   
 0.21 - 23 Dec 2025
 
   - Added a vertical offset setting, which adds the ability to shift the cage 
     off vertical center.
   - Cleaned up code in a number of places (hat tip: Reddit user "oldesole1")
   - Fixed a number of new bugs.
